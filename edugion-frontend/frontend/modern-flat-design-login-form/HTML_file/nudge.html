    <p class = "smallfont" style="color: black">As Edugion consists of many job seekers, we understand the effort to
    create a profile for the perfect fit on your dream companies. We also understand the sadness of getting rejected from them without
    having your profile getting checked at all. With these problems in mind, Edugion comes up with the connection between us and other companies to
    provide a feature called "nudge". This feature will ensure that your profile and interaction of you and your dream company will be
    viewed by the companies.</p>
